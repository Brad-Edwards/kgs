# Knowledge Graph Server Product Brief

## Product Vision

A graph-based knowledge management server that extends AI assistants with structured information management capabilities. Think "Git for knowledge structures" - enabling versioned, schema-validated knowledge graphs that AI tools can seamlessly query and manipulate.

**High-Level Description**
A server system that provides:
- Graph-based knowledge storage
- Schema validation and enforcement
- Version control for knowledge structures
- Context-aware querying
- Relationship management

**Key Value Propositions**
- Transform unstructured knowledge into queryable graphs
- Maintain consistency across complex knowledge structures
- Track and manage knowledge evolution over time
- Enable AI tools to work with structured information
- Support team collaboration on knowledge assets

**Target Users**
Primary:
- AI Assistant Platforms
- Knowledge Management Tools
- Documentation Systems
- Compliance Platforms

Secondary:
- Enterprise Search Systems
- Training Platforms
- Decision Support Tools

## High-Level Features

**Core Functionality**

1. Knowledge Structure Management
   - Node and relationship creation
   - Schema enforcement
   - Attribute management
   - Bulk operations

2. Version Control
   - Change tracking
   - History navigation
   - Branching support
   - Merge operations

3. Context Management
   - Relationship-based retrieval
   - Context expansion
   - Path finding
   - Relevance scoring

**Key Differentiators**
- Built for AI tool integration
- Version control for graph structures
- Schema-enforced knowledge representation
- Relationship-centric design

**MVP Scope**
1. Basic graph operations
2. Simple schema validation
3. Version tracking
4. Path queries
5. Context retrieval
6. Integration API

## Constraints & Considerations

**Technical Limitations**
- Graph query performance
- Schema flexibility vs enforcement
- Version control overhead
- State management complexity

**Integration Requirements**
- Must work with existing AI platforms
- Support standard graph formats
- Enable custom schema definitions
- Provide clean API abstractions

**Timeline Considerations**
- MVP: 2-3 months
- Beta: 4-5 months
- V1: 8 months
- Early adopter program by month 3

**Risk Factors**
- Graph database scalability
- Schema standardization
- Version control complexity
- Integration challenges
- Performance at scale
